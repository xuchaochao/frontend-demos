# About
Book Reading Notes and Code Implementation for *Instant HTML5 Presentations How-to* by *Davi Ferreira*.

# What is Added
I am someone who would like all codes to be organized well and look neat. So I managed to do that.

# Notice
Based on Code Presented on Book, with some of my own modification. A newer version of Reveal.js is employed.
