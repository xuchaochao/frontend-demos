# Introduction
Book Reading Notes and Code Re-implementation for *Building Impressive Presentations with impress-js* by *Rakhitha Nimesh Ratnayake*.

# What is different from offical code demo
I am someone who would like all codes to be organized well and look neat. So I managed to do that.

So this is based on *Official Code Release*, but with some of my own modification.
